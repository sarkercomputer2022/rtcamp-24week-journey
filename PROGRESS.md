### Daily Log

#### Day 1 - Saturday, Oct 18, 2025
- [x] Setup: Created 24-week folder structure ✅
- [x] Initialized Git repository ✅
- [x] Watched video: var, let, const explained ✅
- [x] Read FreeCodeCamp article on variables ✅
- [x] Created practice files ✅
- [x] Completed variables exercises ✅
- [x] Solved 5 type coercion problems ✅
- [x] Documented learning in notes.md ✅
- [x] Pushed to GitHub ✅
- [x] Time: 2.5 hours ✅
- [x] Status: DAY 1 COMPLETED! 🎉

**What I learned:**
- var vs let vs const differences
- Block scope vs function scope
- Hoisting behavior
- Type coercion rules ("5" + 3 vs "5" - 3)
- Always use const by default, let when needed, never use var

#### Day 2 - Sunday, Oct 19, 2025
- [x] Topic: JavaScript Functions ✅
- [x] Learned: Function declarations ✅
- [x] Learned: Function expressions ✅
- [x] Learned: Arrow functions ✅
- [x] Learned: Default parameters ✅
- [x] Learned: Callback functions ✅
- [x] Created: day2-functions.js file ✅
- [x] Practiced: 6 function variations ✅
- [x] Documented learning in notes.md ✅
- [x] Pushed to GitHub ✅
- [x] Time: 2 hours ✅
- [x] Status: DAY 2 COMPLETED! 🎉

**What I learned:**
- Function declarations are hoisted, expressions are not
- Arrow functions have shorter syntax: `(a, b) => a + b`
- Default parameters provide fallback values
- Callbacks: functions passed as arguments
- Use arrow functions for short operations

#### Day 3 - Monday, Oct 20, 2025
#### Day 3 - Monday, Oct 20, 2025
- [x] Topic: JavaScript Objects ✅
- [x] Learned: Object creation (3 methods) ✅
- [x] Learned: Property access (dot & bracket notation) ✅
- [x] Learned: Object methods & 'this' keyword ✅
- [x] Learned: Nested objects ✅
- [x] Learned: Object destructuring ✅
- [x] Learned: Built-in object methods (keys, values, entries) ✅
- [x] Created: day3-objects.js (10 concepts) ✅
- [x] Created: day3-object-problems.js (6 problems) ✅
- [x] Practiced: 5 problems + 1 bonus ✅
- [x] Documented learning in notes.md ✅
- [x] Time: 2.5 hours ✅
- [x] Status: DAY 3 COMPLETED! 🎉

**What I learned:**
- Objects are key-value pairs, like a dictionary
- Use object literal syntax: `const obj = {}`
- `this` keyword refers to the object (but NOT in arrow functions!)
- Destructuring makes extracting properties super easy
- Object methods are functions inside objects

**Key Discovery:**
- Arrow functions as object methods DON'T work! Always use regular function syntax for methods.
