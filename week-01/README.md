## Weekly Structure

### ✅ Day 1 (Oct 18) - Variables & Type Coercion
**Time:** 2.5 hours  
**Topics:** var, let, const, scope, hoisting, type coercion

**What I learned:**
- Always use const by default, let when needed
- Block scope vs function scope
- Type coercion can cause unexpected bugs

**Files:**
- `exercises/day1-variables.js`
- `exercises/day1-type-coercion.js`

---

### ✅ Day 2 (Oct 19) - Functions
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Topics:** Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, defaults, callbacks

**What I learned:**
- Arrow functions have shorter syntax
- Function declarations are hoisted
- Callbacks are functions passed as arguments

**Files:**
- `exercises/day2-functions.js`

---

### ⏳ Day 3 (Oct 20) - Objects
**Topics:** Object creation, properties, methods, destructuring, `this` keyword

**Plan:**
- Create objects with properties
- Add methods to objects
- Practice object destructuring
- Understand `this` context
- 5 object manipulation problems

---

### ⏳ Day 4 (Oct 21) - Arrays
**Topics:** Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach, find)

**Plan:**
- Practice array iteration methods
- Understand functional programming concepts
- Chain array methods
- 10 array problems

---

### ⏳ Day 5 (Oct 22) - Loops & Conditionals
**Topics:** for, while, if/else, switch, ternary operator

**Plan:**
- Master different loop types
- Nested loops practice
- Conditional logic patterns
- 5 loop problems

---

### ⏳ Day 6 (Oct 23) - Practice & Review
**Topics:** Combined practice, debugging, code challenges

**Plan:**
- Review all Week 1 concepts
- Solve mixed problems
- Debug common errors
- Prepare for week project

---

### ⏳ Day 7 (Oct 24) - Week 1 Project
**Project:** Task Manager CLI

**Requirements:**
- Create tasks (objects)
- Store in array
- Functions to add/remove/list tasks
- Use loops for iteration
- Pure JavaScript, no frameworks
