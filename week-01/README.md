**Dates:** October 18-24, 2025  
**Status:** 🟢 In Progress (Day 3/7 Complete)  
**Hours Spent:** 7/12 target

---

## Overview

This week focuses on JavaScript core fundamentals - the building blocks of all JavaScript code.

**Learning Goals:**
- Master variable declarations and scope
- Understand function types and usage
- Work with objects and their methods
- Practice array manipulation
- Control program flow with loops and conditionals

---

## Weekly Structure

### ✅ Day 1 (Oct 18) - Variables & Type Coercion
**Time:** 2.5 hours  
**Topics:** var, let, const, scope, hoisting, type coercion

**What I learned:**
- Always use const by default, let when needed
- Block scope vs function scope
- Type coercion can cause unexpected bugs

**Files:**
- `exercises/day1-variables.js`
- `exercises/day1-type-coercion.js`

---

### ✅ Day 2 (Oct 19) - Functions
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Topics:** Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, defaults, callbacks

**What I learned:**
- Arrow functions have shorter syntax
- Function declarations are hoisted
- Callbacks are functions passed as arguments

**Files:**
- `exercises/day2-functions.js`

---

### ✅ Day 3 (Oct 20) - Objects
**Time:** 2.5 hours  
**Topics:** Object creation, properties, methods, `this` keyword, destructuring

**What I learned:**
- Objects are collections of key-value pairs
- Three ways to create objects (literal is best)
- `this` keyword doesn't work in arrow functions
- Destructuring is powerful and clean

**Files:**
- `exercises/day3-objects.js`
- `exercises/day3-object-problems.js`

---

### ⏳ Day 4 (Oct 21) - Arrays
**Topics:** Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach, find)

**Plan:**
- Practice array iteration methods
- Understand functional programming concepts
- Chain array methods
- 10 array problems

---

### ⏳ Day 5 (Oct 22) - Loops & Conditionals
**Topics:** for, while, if/else, switch, ternary operator

**Plan:**
- Master different loop types
- Nested loops practice
- Conditional logic patterns
- 5 loop problems

---

### ⏳ Day 6 (Oct 23) - Practice & Review
**Topics:** Combined practice, debugging, code challenges

**Plan:**
- Review all Week 1 concepts
- Solve mixed problems
- Debug common errors
- Prepare for week project

---

### ⏳ Day 7 (Oct 24) - Week 1 Project
**Project:** Task Manager CLI

**Requirements:**
- Create tasks (objects)
- Store in array
- Functions to add/remove/list tasks
- Use loops for iteration
- Pure JavaScript, no frameworks

---

## Key Learnings

### What Went Well
✅ Understood var vs let vs const deeply  
✅ Discovered variable shadowing bug with nested loops  
✅ Grasped arrow function syntax quickly  
✅ Mastered object creation and methods  
✅ Good documentation habits established  

### Challenges Faced
⚠️ Understanding `this` context in arrow functions  
⚠️ Remembering when to use implicit vs explicit return  
⚠️ Type coercion edge cases  
⚠️ When to use arrow functions vs regular functions in objects

### Solutions Found
💡 Used `let` to fix nested loop bug  
💡 Practice more examples to understand `this`  
💡 Created comparison table for function types  
💡 **RULE: Never use arrow functions as object methods!**
